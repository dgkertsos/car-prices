This is the final project for the DataTalks Club Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2024.

In this project we will display used car sales in the United States.

Dataset
*******
We will use the Vehicles Sales dataset from Kaggle. The dataset can be found in the URL below:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data

After downloading the dataset it was divided into 4 parts because of the gitHub limitation of uploading files up to 25MB each.

The four files can be found in the data folder.
